# Ovum Spotlight (ComfyUI extension)

This repository contains the Ovum Spotlight UI and backend routes split out from the original project.

Install by cloning this repo into your ComfyUI root so that the path is:

<ComfyUI>\custom_nodes\ovum_spotlight

No extra configuration is required. Once ComfyUI restarts, the spotlight UI and routes will be available.
